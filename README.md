# Electio

Electio is an e-voting application that allows election administrators to design an electoral system fit for their uses. The system strengthens democracy by applying a decentralised tallying system. By using the ethereum blockchain, consensus can be determined as to the state of the votes, thereby removing the need for a central tallying process in the election system, voters can count the votes themselves locally.
